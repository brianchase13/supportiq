## 🛠 **Technical Architecture**

### Core Stack
```
Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind
Backend: Next.js API Routes + Supabase
Charts: Tremor (beautiful by default)
AI: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (cost efficient)
Payments: Stripe
Auth: Clerk/NextAuth.js
```

### API Endpoints
```
/api/auth/intercom - OAuth initiation
/api/auth/intercom/callback - OAuth callback
/api/intercom/sync - Fetch and cache tickets
/api/analyze - GPT-4 categorization + sentiment
/api/insights - Generate actionable recommendations
/api/tickets - CRUD operations for tickets
/api/users - User management
```

### Database Schema (Supabase)
```sql
users: id, email, intercom_token, subscription_status
tickets: id, user_id, content, category, sentiment, response_time
insights: id, user_id, type, title, description, impact_score
sync_logs: id, user_id, status, records_processed, error_message
```

## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

### Technical Risks
1. **Intercom API Rate Limits**
   - Solution: Implement exponential backoff
   - Cache aggressively, sync incrementally

2. **GPT-4 Cost Explosion**
   - Solution: Use GPT-4o-mini, batch processing
   - Implement usage tracking and limits

3. **Database Performance**
   - Solution: Proper indexing, data cleanup
   - Archive old tickets after 90 days

### Business Risks
1. **Low Conversion Rate**
   - Solution: Focus on clear ROI demonstration
   - Free trial with real insights

2. **Customer Acquisition Cost**
   - Solution: Content marketing, community engagement
   - Product-led growth strategy

3. **Competition from Zendesk/Intercom**
   - Solution: Focus on insights, not ticket management
   - Partner with them, don't compete
